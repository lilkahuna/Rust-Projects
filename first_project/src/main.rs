/** IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
 * Unsigned means only positive(0-255), while signed means positive or negative(-128-127)
 * A signed integer uses the first bit to store sign information. 0 for positive and vice versa.
 * 8 bits is a byte
 * A bit stores 0 or 1
 * i32 is the default integer type of rust
 * Associated functions belong to the type, not the instance
 * Structs, enums, pattern matching, traits ,and impl blocks
 * Vectors are like lists
 * Rust will panic in order to protect from buffer overread
 * :? is a formatting directive
 * traits are shared behaviors
 * ? unwraps the Result enum and handles it
